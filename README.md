# NYC Taxi Data Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive analysis project focused on the fascinating world of New York City's Yellow Taxi services. In the bustling streets of the city that never sleeps, these iconic taxis paint a vivid picture of the urban ebb and flow. We aim to illuminate the intricate dynamics of the NYC Yellow Taxi service and provide data-driven insights that could influence future operational, pricing, and technological decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset we explore is the Yellow Taxi Trip Records, provided by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) of New York City. The data captures rich details such as pick-up and drop-off times, locations, passenger counts, trip distances, and payment types.

## Methods Used
- Data cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data Visualization

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. __Data Loading and Exploration:__ Initial phase involves loading the dataset and performing a preliminary exploration to familiarize ourselves with the data structure and contents.

2. __Data Cleaning:__ Here, we identify and address issues in our dataset such as missing or inconsistent values, outliers, and irrelevant information.

3. __Feature Engineering:__ This section involves constructing new features from existing data that can provide us with deeper and more nuanced insights.

4. __Data Analysis and Visualization:__ Applying analytical techniques to unearth patterns and trends in our data. Findings are visualized using engaging and informative plots.

5. __Conclusion and Management Summary:__ Encapsulates key findings and provides a summary that caters to decision-makers. This section translates our data-driven insights into actionable recommendations.
