# NYC Taxi Data Analysis

## Introduction
The attached dataset contains a sample from the Yellow Taxi Trip Records Data Set provided by the TLC of NYC.

With this dataset I will study has a lot of details like pick-up and drop-off times, locations, passenger counts, trip distances, and payment types. With this data, I will try to find patterns and trends that are not easy to see.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. __Data Loading and Exploration:__ Initial phase involves loading the dataset and performing a preliminary exploration to familiarize ourselves with the data structure and contents.

2. __Data Cleaning:__ Here, we identify and address issues in our dataset such as missing or inconsistent values, outliers, and irrelevant information.

3. __Feature Engineering:__ This section involves constructing new features from existing data that can provide us with deeper and more nuanced insights.

4. __Data Analysis and Visualization:__ Applying analytical techniques to unearth patterns and trends in our data. Findings are visualized using engaging and informative plots.

5. __Conclusion and Management Summary:__ Encapsulates key findings and provides a summary that caters to decision-makers. This section translates our data-driven insights into actionable recommendations.
